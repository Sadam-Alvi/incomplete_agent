Given the user's question, perform BOTH tasks:

1. Rewrite the question into one concise, direct search query.
2. Generate 6 alternative search queries that preserve the user's
   original intent while exploring different relevant phrasings.

Instructions:
- Remove conversational filler.
- Preserve the original meaning and technical terminology.
- Include relevant entities and context.
- Make alternatives meaningfully different, not simple repetitions.
- Do not answer the question.
- Do not include explanations, numbering, or bullet points.

Return EXACTLY this format:

<alternative query 2>
<alternative query 3>
<alternative query 4>
<alternative query 5>
<alternative query 6>"""
